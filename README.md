Assignment 6
# Problem
The programer needs to create a python program that has class named "TV" and another program that sets a test driver named "TestTV" and will execute the two objects given, and finally print the provided output.
# About the Program
'''
Classes furnish a simple way to group data members and methods in one location.
'''
This practice of program is under Module 4 in our subject but also the introduction of object-oriented programming. With this python classes, it let programmers organize codes concerning to functionality and data. When we create a new class in Python, we also establish a new object type and make it possible to generate new instances of that specific object type.
# Usage
'''
class_name = blueprint for creating objects.
def __init__ = is used to initialize the attributes of an object as soon as the object is formed.
